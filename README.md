# Docker Project

These Repository contains the files of the docker project I had done. Here I had created a django application which is an school admissions website. After that I had dockerized that application using docker.

You can run these project by downloading the repository and inside terminal run the command "docker compose up --build" after locating into these directory using "cd" command. (Before that make sure you have docker installed in your system)
